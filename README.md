# Archive
This repo doesn't add anything new anymore to the original adblock extension, charlie implemented all the changes I did in his original script so I'm archiving this

# SpicetifyAdBlock
This is an extension of @CharlieS1103 Ad blocker extension,
most of the credit should go to him so go and drop a star at
[his extension](https://github.com/CharlieS1103/spicetify-extensions)

## My modification
I simply ~~added support to remove the htop(the big ad at the top of the main page)
and~~ removed the Upgrade button from the UI

## Installation
Simply run:
`cp adblock.js ~/.config/spicetify/Extensions`  
`spicetify config extensions adblock.js`  
`spicetify apply`

and enjoy an ad free spotify experience
